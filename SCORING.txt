points are accumulated in two ways:

1:
a player places a piece on a neutral tile
  this grants one point, regardless of the number of pieces on that tile

2:
a player captures a tile that does not belong to them by toppling onto it
  this grants points equal to the number of pieces on that tile

notes:
- yes, I am aware that these rules for scoring would favor toppling onto a neutral tile
    if it were to somehow get more than one piece on it
